Wakkerbot

The complete(?) history of wakkerbot, assembled from
a set of archived files I kept around on my filesystem
All commits have been antedated using their filesystem dates.

Wakkerbot originates from Megahal, but has been seriously changed over time.

FYI: the original Megahal was licenced undera BSD-like licence (and still available).
I narrowed the licence down to GPL3, which of cource is only applicable to the changes I made.
